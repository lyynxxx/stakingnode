System upgrade
(https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:System_upgrade)


This page explains how to run a series of command line steps to live upgrade your system to the latest version of openSUSE. A live upgrade from the prior version is officially supported. This allows to perform a complete operating system upgrade in place, without reloading everything from scratch. 

Update system to the latest packages
#zypper ref
#zypper up

Update the repos
Check if your Leap repos defined in /etc/zypp/repos.d/ are using the $releasever variable already. If they are still hard-coded with a particular Leap version number, then you need to modify them first. For example, assuming your current version is Leap 15.3, then this can be done with.

#sed -i 's/15.3/${releasever}/g' /etc/zypp/repos.d/*.repo

Refresh with the new repos
Switch and refresh all repositories to 15.4
#zypper --releasever=15.4 refresh

Execute the full distribution upgrade
#zypper --releasever=15.4 dup

Once the dup is finished, openSUSE sets the releasever variable to the new version

#reboot
